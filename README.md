# kr0nos

kr0nos is a minimal operating system written entirely in x86 assembly.
Its goal is to provide a small, understandable, and easily extendable OS kernel.

## Version History

| Version | Changes |
|---------|---------|
| 0.0.1   | Initial project setup |
| 0.0.2   | Added "about" command |
| 0.0.2.1 | Fixed "about" command |
| 0.0.2.2 | Boot and kernel fixes, improved Makefile, preparation for filesystem |
| 0.0.3   | Kernel refactored, command system fixed, added "read" and "uname" |
| 0.0.3.1 | Exit command fixed (QEMU compat) |
| 0.0.4   | 16-bit real mode → 32-bit protected mode |
| 0.0.5   | Added `sysinfo` command (CPU + RAM), memory detection moved to bootloader, unknown command error message |

## Features

- Minimal x86 Assembly-based kernel (32-bit protected mode)
- Simple command-line shell
  - `help`     – Show available commands
  - `clear`    – Clear the screen
  - `exit`     – Shut down the OS (ACPI / HLT)
  - `about`    – Show OS information
  - `uname`    – Show system name
  - `read`     – Read and hex-dump a disk sector (experimental, ATA PIO LBA28)
  - `sysinfo`  – Show CPU info (CPUID) and RAM size (E820 via bootloader)
- Modular driver system (`drivers/`)
- Structured build system (`Makefile`)
- Testable using QEMU

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build
make

# Run in QEMU (graphical)
make run

# Run in terminal (text mode)
make run-text

# Debug mode (serial output)
make debug

# Syntax check
make check

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```
